    <p>If you are reading this, I've just converted the front end of this site to react, and added backend capabilities. Hope you enjoy.</p>

    <p>Hey! It's been a while. First things first, I didn't end up learning Django... But some other developments in my life have taken place. I quit my job at Mathnasium. That was a great job so if anyone from there is reading this, you're the best, including any of my students. But there's a reason I quit...</p>
    
    <p> I got into grad school! At SCU! It was a very fast decision, but I managed to eke my way in at the last minute. My classes are awesome, and it feels great to have programming projects to do all day. I'm currently learning computer vision, and I'm taking a class where you make a bot to make original art. I can't wait to learn more, life is good right now. </p>
    
    <p>And that's all the big news since my last post. Hope you all had some happy holidays. Peace</p>

    <h2>Entry 4: 9/5/21</h2>
    
    <p>Hey, it's me again. Just wanted to update my many fans on the state of this site. Over the past few weeks, I've made a lot of bug fixes, as well as some updates to 'Space Nun' in the arcade. And now, I've become pretty comfortable with the web dev languages, and I feel it's time to learn something new. So, I'm learning Django!</p>
    
    <p>I decided on Django because, as someone currently searching for a job, it seemed like a good way to practice my python skills while simultaneously building the site. I'm not 100% sure what I'm getting myself into, but I'll never really know until I start, so here goes I guess.</p>
    
    <p>As for now, I'll see you when I see you.</p>

    <p>Hiya, it's been a while. I've been busy with job training, interview practice, and just life in general, but I'm gonna set aside some time for the website this week. I've also been doing a NODE.js tutorial, so expect some new things in the future.</p>
    
    <p>Wait! I forgot that nobody reads this... So I guess I'm just writing to nobody. Blogging into the void.</p>
    
    <p>Alright guys, that's enough existential rambling from me. See ya when I see ya.</p>

    <h2>Entry 2: 8/8/21</h2>
    <p>I got a job!</p>
    <p>It's been a busy week. I've been doing a lot of leetcodes to prepare for future interveiws, been working on the arcade, and I am officially, as of tomorrow, employed as a math intructor. I've also been learning more about fullstack development, which I'm realizing is going to take at least a bit of time. Updates to come.</p>
    
    <p>On a side note, I've been replaying 'The Last of Us Part 2,' and I gotta say it's just as good the second time as the first. Love that game.</p>
    
    <p>Okay, that's all I got.</p>

    <p>Hello whoever is reading this,</p>
    <p>I haven't had social media for a while now, so I'm not really sure how
    to approach this whole "blog" thing. What do people even post about? I don't</p>

    <p>Her name is Britney. She's cute right?</p>

    <p>Alright, hope you liked the pug pic, that's the best I got in terms of
      internet content.</p>
